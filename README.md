This ReactJS application stores user and card information in a PostgreSQL database. Login to view the user's current card collection. You will see the total approximate value of the collection in the top left corner. You can click on one of the five mana symbols above the card collection to sort the cards by that color. Click "Reset Colors" to remove the filter.

Click "Search for Cards" and enter the name of a card into the input box in order to search the API for that card. Click "Save to Collection" under a card in the search results to add that card to the user's collection. The card can be deleted from the collection by going back to "View Collection" and clicking "Delete Card".

You can logout with the button on the header, and once logged out you will find that the collection and search routes are protected:
